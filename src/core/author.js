 * instead of filling a widescreen television. Verified by measuring the encoded
 * frame: with the intermediate the edges came out black, without it the design
 * reaches both edges.
 *
 * `interlace=tff` matches the titles' field order. A menu that disagrees with
 * the titles makes some televisions re-sync between the menu and the film,
 * which shows up as a black flicker.
 *
 * With `audioPath` the page becomes a motion menu: the same still frame is held
 * for as long as the sound runs, and the player waits for the remote afterwards
