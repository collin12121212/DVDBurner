# Put the tools Burnhouse needs into <output-dir>, built to run on macOS 12.
#
# macOS only. Invoked by the GitHub Actions macOS build.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The obvious way to get these tools is Homebrew, and it does not work here. On
# the Intel runner image — macOS 15 — every Homebrew bottle is built with a
# minimum of macOS 14.0. The Mac this app is for is a 2017 MacBook Air, whose
# newest possible macOS is 12.7.6, and a binary that needs 14 does not run there
# at all. The app would install, launch, and fail the moment a video was added.
#
# So the tools are either taken prebuilt with a low deployment target, or
# compiled here with one. Nothing is installed with Homebrew.
#
#   ffmpeg, ffprobe  static x86_64 builds for macOS 10.13, from evermeet.cx.
#                    Static means no libraries to relocate and nothing to go
#                    stale on somebody else's machine.
#   dvdauthor,spumux compiled from source with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0,
#                    linked against libpng (also built here, also for 12) and
#                    otherwise only against libraries macOS ships.
#
# freetype, fontconfig and fribidi are deliberately NOT provided. dvdauthor's
# configure only uses them for text-based subtitles, which this app does not
# produce, and leaving them out keeps the build small and its dependencies to
# system libraries only.
